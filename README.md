# Whac-A-Mole

A replication of the classic "Whac-A-Mole" arcade game, implemented as a VR game in Unity. This game is largely based on another Unity (boxing) exergame developed by Toni Pesola. 

For game details, see the paper "SIM2VR: Towards Automated Biomechanical Testing in VR" [todo: add link] and the corresponding [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fl0fischer/sim2vr.)

## Troubleshooting

When building, if you get an error complaining something about erroneous "guid" for some prefabs/meshes go to "Assets" -> "Reimport all"
