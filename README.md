# Whac-a-mole

This game is largely based on another Unity (boxing) exergame, developed by Toni Pesola. Network communication functionality ("Unity-Python bridge" with ZMQ) in UserInTheBox asset) originally developed by Markus Kirjonen.


When building, if you get an error complaining something about erroneous "guid" for the boxing glove prefab/mesh go to "Assets" -> "Reimport all"
